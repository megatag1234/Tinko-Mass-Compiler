## 🖥️ Making an OS with TinkoMass

TinkoMass is more than just a programming language — it’s a **tool to build your own OS**!  
Here’s how you can do it step by step.

### Write your OS code in TinkoMass
- Create a `.mass` file
- Use built-in functions like:
  ```mass
  graphics(800, 600)
  fill(blue)
  draw(rect: 200, 150, 100, 100)
  log(G, "Hello Tinko OS!", 50, 100, 50)
